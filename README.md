 What is Emmet?
Emmet is a powerful toolkit for web developers that significantly improves HTML and CSS workflow by enabling rapid code generation and abbreviation expansion. Originally known as Zen Coding, Emmet provides shorthand syntax for writing HTML and CSS code, allowing developers to write complex markup and styles with fewer keystrokes.

 Difference between a Library and Framework?
  libraries target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.

  What is CDN? Why do we use it?
  A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a distributed network of servers strategically positioned in multiple locations around the world. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content to users more quickly, reliably, and efficiently by reducing latency and improving performance. 

  
A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a distributed network of servers strategically positioned in multiple locations around the world. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content to users more quickly, reliably, and efficiently by reducing latency and improving performance. Here's why we use CDNs:

Faster Content Delivery: CDNs store cached copies of website content, such as images, scripts, stylesheets, and videos, on servers located closer to users. When a user requests content from a website, the CDN serves the content from the nearest server, reducing the time it takes for the content to reach the user's device. This results in faster page load times and a better user experience.

Improved Website Performance: By offloading the delivery of static content to CDNs, websites can free up resources on their origin servers, allowing them to focus on processing dynamic content and user requests more efficiently. This helps improve overall website performance and scalability, particularly during periods of high traffic or spikes in demand.

High Availability and Redundancy: CDNs offer redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability. If one CDN server becomes unavailable due to maintenance, network issues, or other factors, requests are automatically routed to other servers in the network, minimizing downtime and ensuring uninterrupted access to content.

Global Reach: CDNs have a global presence, with servers located in various regions and countries around the world. This enables websites to serve content to users worldwide with minimal latency, regardless of their geographic location. By distributing content across multiple servers, CDNs help websites reach a broader audience and improve accessibility for users in different regions.

Scalability: CDNs are designed to handle large volumes of traffic and scale dynamically to accommodate spikes in demand. As website traffic fluctuates throughout the day or in response to marketing campaigns or events, CDNs automatically adjust to meet the demand, ensuring that websites remain responsive and accessible to users.

Overall, CDNs play a crucial role in modern web infrastructure by optimizing content delivery, improving website performance, enhancing reliability, and ensuring a seamless user experience for visitors around the world.
